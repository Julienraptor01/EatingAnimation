This is a simple fork of https://github.com/Theoness1/EatingAnimation that i made.
<br>The support for mods is fully integrated instead of in a toggleable RP, the CIT fix PR (https://github.com/Theoness1/EatingAnimation/pull/16) is merged and it has my Vanilla Tweaks compatibility pack (https://github.com/Julienraptor01/Eating-Animation-Smaller-Utilities-Compatibility)
